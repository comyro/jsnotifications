jsNotifications is a JavaScript class to show notifications using webkitNotifications as first option (for Google Chrome and Chromium) or Gritter for jQuery (if the browser does not have support for webkitNotifcations or webkitNotifications are locked by the user in Google Chrome or Chromium). Also, if the jQuery library or the Gritter plugin are not available, the jsNotifications class will show the messages using the classic JavaScript alert method.
